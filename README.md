# eprints-vagrant

A vagrant setup for working with EPrints 3.3 on CentOS 7.

## Install

Steps I followed on my Mac OS X box to get EPrints 3.3. up.

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
3. Clone rsdoiel/eprints-vagrant Github repository
4. Change directory to eprints-vagrant
5. Run "vagrant up" to create the box and provision
6. Run "vagrant ssh" to finish MySQL and EPrints setup
7. Run "bash sbin/1-final-setup.sh" (this finishes the MySQL setup and prep)
8. Switch the eprints user and run "bash 2-final-setup.sh" (configures a new eprints repository)
9. Switch back to the vagrant user and run "bash sbin/3-final-setup.sh" (final permission cleanup and apache restart)

Steps 1 and 2 are your typical Mac app install (e.g. go to the website, download
the dmg/pkg and install those apps). The rest of run from my Mac's Terminal app.

Here are the shell commands for steps 3 through 6.

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/rsdoiel/eprints-vagrant.git
    cd eprints-vagrant
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
```

At this stage you could finish setting up MySQL and follow Adam Field's training video
[Training Video: EPrints Install](http://wiki.eprints.org/w/Training_Video:EPrints_Install).
Or user the 1-final-setup.sh, 2-final-setup.sh and 3-final-setup.sh scripts in this
repository.


At this point you have an empty EPrints repository running on the guest machine.
You can access this from your host machine web browser with a little more work.
You need to add an entry to your */etc/hosts* file so that your guest machines
virtual hostname will be accessible from your host machines web browser. Before
you can do that you need to know the IP address assigned by DHCP to your guest
machine. This can be done by ssh-ing into your guest machine and running ifconfig.

```shell
    vagrant ssh
    ifconfig
```

Read the output of *ifconfig* and find the assigned IP address. On my guest
machine it was assigned 172.28.128.3, yours will be different. It was the second
entry reported by *ifconfig*.  I had named my new repository "mydemo"
on host "eprints-dev.local" so I added the following entry to */etc/hosts*.

```shell
    172.28.128.3 eprints-dev.local mydemo.eprints-dev.local
```

Adam Field talks about accesing updating */etc/hosts* in the EPrints wiki video
[Training Video: EPrints Install](http://wiki.eprints.org/w/Training_Video:EPrints_Install).
The */etc/hosts* is discussed at about four minutes and nineteen seconds.
